# 法藏九柱枢要篇 / The Nine Pillars of Fa: Essential Summary

> 道立而法生。此九柱者，承道之枢机，衍术之纲领。观其名，可知其用；思其义，可通其变。
> With the Dao established, the Fa arises. These Nine Pillars bear the pivot of the Dao and outline the principles from which techniques derive. Observe their names to understand their use; ponder their meanings to comprehend their transformations.

## 一、《竹节生长论》 / I. *The Theory of Bamboo-Joint Growth*
**枢要**：语言之能，如竹破土，节节分明，生生不息。立宏观修炼之阶次。
**Essential Principle**: Language capacity is like bamboo breaking through soil—joint by joint, clear and distinct, living and unceasing. Establishes the macroscopic stages of cultivation.

## 二、《时体语玄模型》 / II. *The Space-Time-Body-Speech Mystery Model*
**枢要**：时体非徒语法之规，乃意识投射时空之玄窗。解时间表达之深层认知图式。
**Essential Principle**: Tense and aspect are not merely grammatical rules, but mysterious windows through which consciousness projects onto time and space. Deciphers the deep cognitive schemata of temporal expression.

## 三、《意形气式模型》 / III. *The Intention-Form-Energy-Pattern Model*
**枢要**：意动而形随，气贯则式成。剖析语句形态与表达气韵之内外关联。
**Essential Principle**: Where intention moves, form follows; where energy permeates, pattern completes. Analyzes the internal and external connections between sentence morphology and expressive vitality.

## 四、《英中语桥》 / IV. *The English-Chinese Language Bridge* (A Manifestation of the Dao-Ben Bridge)
**枢要**：以道本为基，架中英思维之津梁。示範跨语言生成之具体映射法则。
**Essential Principle**: Based on the Dao-Ben Bridge, it constructs a thoroughfare between Chinese and English thinking. Demonstrates the concrete mapping laws of cross-lingual generation.

## 五、《词喻理论》 / V. *The Theory of Lexical Metaphor* (A Specialization of the Symbol-Meaning Algorithm)
**枢要**：词非死物，喻为其魂。构建词汇隐喻之独立认知体系，为词喻家族之基石。
**Essential Principle**: Words are not dead objects; metaphor is their soul. Constructs an independent cognitive system for lexical metaphor, forming the cornerstone of the "Word-Metaphor" product family.

## 六、《因果双法》 / VI. *The Dual Method of Cause and Effect* (Seeking Root & Cultivating by Fruit)
**枢要**：寻根固本，执果修因。思维流转之二元根本法，乃逻辑生成之经纬。
**Essential Principle**: Seek the root to solidify the foundation; grasp the fruit to cultivate the cause. The binary fundamental method of thought flow, the warp and weft of logical generation.

## 七、《生成逻辑链》 / VII. *The Generative Logic Chain* (Sentence-Paragraph-Discourse)
**枢要**：自句至段，由段成篇，逻辑如链，环环相生。定言语扩展之线性规程。
**Essential Principle**: From sentence to paragraph, from paragraph to discourse—logic is like a chain, each link generating the next. Defines the linear procedure for verbal expansion.

## 八、《三四四模型》 / VIII. *The Three-Four-Four Model* (Three/Four Parts of Speech, Four Components)
**枢要**：三性四成分，句法之原子。解构核心句之生成元，如七巧之板，可拼万形。
**Essential Principle**: Three/four parts of speech, four components—the atoms of syntax. Deconstructs the generative units of core sentences, like seven-piece puzzles that can assemble myriad forms.

## 九、《认知生成流》 / IX. *The Cognitive Generative Flow* (Its Core: Cognitive Fluid)
**枢要**：心流、思流、语流，三流合一，生生不已。摹写意识化为言语之动态过程。
**Essential Principle**: Heart-flow, thought-flow, speech-flow—three streams unite as one, ceaselessly generating. Depicts the dynamic process by which consciousness transforms into speech.

*九柱巍巍，撑起法度乾坤。每一柱下，皆有详论与衍生之术。此乃道之延伸，亦为术之所依。*
*These Nine Pillars stand majestic, supporting the cosmos of laws and measures. Beneath each pillar lie detailed discussions and derived techniques. They are the extension of the Dao and the basis for all Shu.*
